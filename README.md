# GPUFlow
GPUFlow is a GPU rental marketplace that connects developers needing affordable AI/ML processing power with providers who have idle GPU hardware. The system functions as a secure orchestrator: users submit their code via a Python SDK decorator or makes their request via the web dashboard, and the platform automatically matches and dispatches these jobs to run inside isolated Docker containers on remote provider machines. It handles the end-to-end workflow, including real-time machine monitoring for both the user and provider for various relevant metrics, secure data transfer, job execution, and automated credit-based billing.
